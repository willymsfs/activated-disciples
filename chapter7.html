            <h3>The Disciple's Reliance: Sharing the Same Shadow</h3>
            <p>The chapter opens with the story of Kim Peek, the savant who inspired the movie <em>Rain Man</em>. Despite his genius-level intellect, he was completely dependent on his father for daily life. They were so close, they were said to "share the same shadow." This illustrates the disciple's reliance on Jesus. We may be capable in many areas, but for navigating life and getting to heaven, we are completely dependent on Him.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Without Jesus, we can do nothing." (John 15:5 )</p>

            <h3>Core Concept: The Shape of Your Days is the Shape of Your Life</h3>
            <p>The ancient rabbinic saying, "May you be covered in the dust of your rabbi," meant following so closely that the dust kicked up by his feet covered you. To be covered in the dust of our Rabbi, Jesus, we must "get a life"—that is, we must intentionally create a rhythm to our daily life that ensures we encounter Him often. The structure of our individual days ultimately determines the trajectory of our entire life.</p>

            <p>The author argues that our modern problem of a complex, distracted life is not an external problem to be solved with time management "hacks." It is an internal problem of a disorganized soul. The solution is not to reorganize the externals, but to find one supreme, captivating focus—Jesus—that reorients everything else around Him.</p>

            <h3>Sanctifying Your Day: Living a Sacramental Life</h3>
            <p>The Church provides a rich framework for shaping our day around God. This is called "sanctifying the day"—making it holy. This involves prayer and, most importantly, living a sacramental life.</p>

                    <h4>The Sacraments: Real Encounters</h4>
                    <p>The seven sacraments are not mere symbols; they are real, powerful encounters with the grace of Jesus. They are "powers that come forth from the Body of Christ" (CCC 1116 ). Through them, we get closer to Jesus than even the disciples who walked with Him, because He enters into us.</p>

                <div class="discipline-card">
                    <h4>The Liturgical Year: God's Calendar</h4>
                    <p>The Church year (Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter, Ordinary Time) is a way of conforming our lives to the life of Christ. By following God's calendar, we enter into the rhythm of His saving work and bring order and purpose to our own lives.</p>

                <div class="discipline-card">
                    <h4>Walking with the Saints</h4>
                    <p>The saints are our "cloud of witnesses" and heavenly family. We can study their lives as role models and ask for their prayers. The author suggests creating a personal "crew" of saints—a few you can get to know deeply and who can help you in your specific state in life.</p>

            <h3>Practicing His Presence: The Discipline of Kavanah</h3>
            <p>The rabbis practiced the discipline of <em>kavanah</em>—living with intention, sincere feeling, and direction of heart. This is what it means to be an "intentional disciple." It is a constant awareness of God's presence throughout the entire day, from the moment we wake until we sleep.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: Talking to Jesus Out Loud</h4>
                <p>The author shares a personal discipline: talking to Jesus out loud throughout the day as a real person. This practice does three things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It cuts through the distractions of life and focuses our thoughts.</li>
                    <li>It heightens our awareness of His presence and the seriousness of the relationship.</li>
                    <li>It often brings more to mind than silent prayer, allowing for a more authentic emotional response.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This is about cultivating a never-ending conversation with God, as St. Paul advises: "Rejoice always, pray constantly, give thanks in all circumstances" (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).</p>

            <h3>Chapter 7 Summary & Reflection</h3>
            <p>This chapter calls us to weave the thread of our faith into the entire fabric of our day. By creating a daily rhythm of prayer, participating in the sacramental life of the Church, and practicing a constant awareness of God's presence, we move from being Sunday-only believers to full-time disciples. The goal is to live a unified life where there is no separation between our faith and our daily activities. When we are centered on Christ, our lives find their true simplicity and purpose, and we become so close to Him that we are, indeed, covered in the dust of the Rabbi.</p>
            <h4>Questions for Reflection:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What does my current daily "rhythm" look like? Is it centered on Christ, or on work, worries, and distractions?</li>
                <li>What is one specific practice I can incorporate to "sanctify my day"? (e.g., praying the Angelus, attending a daily Mass once a week, setting a reminder to pray).</li>
                <li>Who would be in my personal "crew" of saints? I will choose one or two saints to learn about and ask for their intercession this week.</li>
