            <h3>The True Starting Point for Discipleship</h3>
            <p>To truly understand what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, we must look to where He looked: the Hebrew Scriptures. Jesus did not come to abolish the Old Testament but to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17 ). Therefore, the roots of Christian discipleship are found not in the New Testament, but in the Old. This is where God first revealed His plan for a people who would walk with Him.</p>
            <p class="quote">As St. Augustine said, "The New Testament lies hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New."</p>

        <section class="concept-section royal-bg">
            <h3>The Surprising Blueprint: The Book of Leviticus</h3>
            <p>Surprisingly, the author points to the Book of Leviticus as the foundational text for understanding discipleship. In Jesus' time, Jewish children began their study of the Torah not with Genesis, but with Leviticus. This was because Leviticus answers the fundamental question for a people freed from bondage (Egypt): "How shall we now live?" It is a book about holiness.</p>

        <section class="concept-section">
            <h3>Core Concept: "Be Holy, for I am Holy"</h3>
            <p>The central command of Leviticus, repeated multiple times, is God's call for His people to be holy just as He is holy. The foundation of discipleship is **imitation**. Israel was called to imitate God in the world. But how do you imitate a God you cannot see?</p>
            <p>God reveals Himself through His words and deeds, providing concrete examples of how to think, speak, and act. This involves distinguishing between the holy and the common, the clean and the unclean, and walking in God's ways rather than the ways of the world.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: God the Creator</h4>
                <p>In Genesis, God is revealed as the Creator. He then commands humanity to imitate Him: "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28 ). By embracing the life-giving nature of marriage and being open to children, humanity imitates the creative, life-giving love of God. This is a tangible way of being "like God."</p>
            </div>

        <section class="concept-section">
            <h3>A Living Example: The Story of Ruth</h3>
            <p>The story of Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, provides a beautiful, human picture of discipleship. Ruth, a Moabite, turns away from the ways of her own people to follow Naomi and embrace the God of Israel. Her famous declaration is the very heart of a disciple's commitment.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>"Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God." (Ruth 1:16)</p>
            </div>
            <p>This decision was not just about Ruth. It was **transgenerational**. Her faithfulness had a ripple effect through history, as she became the great-grandmother of King David, placing her directly in the lineage of Jesus. This shows that our small, daily acts of faithfulness can have an eternal impact.</p>

        <section class="concept-section royal-bg">
            <h3>From the Old to the New: Jesus as the Perfect Imitator</h3>
            <p>Jesus perfectly models this principle of imitation. He doesn't just talk about God; He shows us the Father. His life is a perfect reflection of the Father's will.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does likewise." (John 5:19)</p>
            <p>When Jesus calls us to be "perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48), He is echoing the call from Leviticus. He is inviting us into the same relationship of imitation that He has with the Father. We are to pray as He prays, forgive as He forgives, and love as He loves.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 2 Summary & Reflection</h3>
            <p>This chapter establishes that discipleship is an ancient call to imitate God. The blueprint is found in Leviticus, centered on the call to holiness. This call is not about following abstract rules but about conforming our entire lives to the pattern of God's own life, which is revealed through His actions and perfectly modeled for us in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <h4>Questions for Reflection:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How does knowing that discipleship is about "imitation" change my perspective on my faith?</li>
                <li>The Israelites were called to be distinct from the cultures around them. In what ways is my life distinct from the world's values?</li>
                <li>Like Ruth, have I made a clear decision to follow God, even if it means leaving old ways behind? What does that look like in my daily life?</li>
            </ul>
