                <p class="section-intro">Many of us are like enthusiastic fans in the grandstands of faith—we know the stats, wear the colors, and cheer loudly. But are we on the field? This guide begins with a provocative question: Are you a fan or a follower? It's a journey to bridge the gap between passive belief and an active, life-altering relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>

                    <p>The foundational distinction is understanding the difference between being a "fan" of Jesus and a "follower." A fan admires from a distance, consuming information without application. A follower engages in a transformative relationship that involves putting faith into practice.</p>

                    <h3>Concepts 2 & 3: The Divine Blueprint</h3>
                    <p>Discipleship is an ancient call to **imitate God** ("Be holy, for I am holy"). This journey begins not with our choice, but with God's. He is the Divine Rabbi who **chooses us** first, believing we have the potential to become like Him. Our "yes" is a response to His prior "yes" to us.</p>

                    <p>Becoming a disciple is a structured process, not an accident. It involves taking on the "yoke" of Christ—His entire worldview—and committing to daily disciplines that foster growth. The primary tool for this is the ancient practice of <strong>Lectio Divina</strong>.</p>
