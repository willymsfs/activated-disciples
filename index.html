                <p class="section-intro">This guide begins with a provocative question that frames the entire journey: Are you a fan or a follower? It's a call to move beyond passive belief and into an active, life-altering relationship with Jesus Christ, transforming a faith of information into a faith of transformation.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">This chapter establishes the book's central theme: the critical distinction between passively admiring Jesus (being a fan ) and actively participating in His life and mission (being a follower).</p>

                    <h3>Core Concept: The Enthusiast vs. The Practitioner</h3>
                    <p>It's possible to know everything about a subject—its history, its theory, its gear—without ever actually *doing* it. The author uses his own story of becoming a photography expert who never took photos to illustrate this point. This is the danger of being a "Christian consumer" who accumulates knowledge but sees no life change.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title"><span>Chapter 2</span> Imitating God</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">To understand Christian discipleship, we must look to its Old Testament roots. The call to follow God is not new; it is an ancient invitation to imitate the very life of God Himself.</p>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h3>Core Concept: "Be Holy, for I am Holy"</h3>
                    <p>The blueprint for discipleship is found in the Book of Leviticus, where God calls His people to be holy as He is holy. The foundation of discipleship is **imitation**. But how do you imitate an invisible God? He reveals Himself through His words and deeds, providing concrete examples of how to think, speak, and act. Jesus perfectly models this imitation in the New Testament.</p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h4>Example: The Story of Ruth</h4>
                        <p>Ruth's pledge to Naomi—"Where you go I will go... your people shall be my people, and your God my God"—is a perfect model of a disciple's commitment. She chose to leave her old life and imitate a new one. This act of faithfulness had transgenerational impact, placing her in the lineage of Jesus.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title"><span>Chapter 3</span> Who's Choosing Whom?</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">This chapter reframes our entire understanding of the divine relationship. It tackles a fundamental question: does our journey begin with our choice of God, or His choice of us?</p>
                <div class="concept-card">
                    <h3>Core Concept: Discipleship is About Being Chosen</h3>
                    <p>In the first-century world, a disciple did not choose a rabbi; the rabbi chose the disciple he believed had the potential to become like him. This makes the invitation, "Come, follow me," a profound affirmation. Jesus, as the Divine Rabbi, makes this clear:</p>
                    <div class="quote">"You did not choose me, but I chose you." (John 15:16)</div>
                    <p>This is a powerful, affirming truth. In a world filled with rejection, the Creator of the universe has looked at you, known every detail of your life, and has chosen you. He believes you have the potential to become like Him.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">Becoming a disciple is not an instantaneous event but a structured, lifelong process of learning and transformation, rooted in the educational system of the first century.</p>

                    <h3>Core Concept: The Three Phases of Jewish Education</h3>
                    <p>The ancient path to discipleship involved three distinct stages, moving from foundational knowledge to radical commitment.</p>

                            <p>Ages 14+. For the "best of the best." Leaving everything to follow a rabbi and become like him.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Core Concept: Taking on the "Yoke"</h3>
                    <p>The invitation to follow was paired with the command, "Take my yoke upon you." A rabbi's "yoke" was his entire worldview. To take his yoke meant to fully adopt his teachings as the blueprint for every aspect of life. It is a covenant relationship requiring 100% commitment.</p>
