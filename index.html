            <h3>The Central Question: Are You a Fan or a Follower?</h3>
            <p>Many of us who identify as Christians are, in reality, more like enthusiastic fans than active followers. We know the statistics, we wear the team colors on Sunday, and we might even have a bumper sticker on our car. We admire Jesus from a distance, but our daily lives remain largely unchanged. This book begins with this provocative question to diagnose a common spiritual condition: a faith that is heavy on information but light on transformation.</p>

            <h3>The Problem: A Disconnect Between Belief and Practice</h3>
            <p>The core problem "The Activated Disciple" seeks to solve is the disconnect between what we say we believe and how we actually live. It's possible to be a "Christian consumer"—accumulating knowledge, listening to sermons, and reading books—without ever truly putting that faith into practice. This leads to a faith that can become stagnant, boring, and ultimately, powerless.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>"So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead." (James 2:17 )</p>
            </div>
            <p>This book is a roadmap designed to bridge that gap. It's a call to move beyond a mere intellectual agreement with Jesus and to enter into a dynamic, life-altering relationship with Him.</p>

            <h3>The Solution: A Journey into Activated Discipleship</h3>
            <p>The solution is not to simply "try harder." It is to rediscover the ancient, time-tested path of discipleship. This book will guide you on a journey to understand what it truly means to be a follower of Jesus by exploring:</p>

            <h3>Your Adventure Awaits</h3>
            <p>This introduction is an invitation. It's a call to leave the comfort of the spectator's box and step onto the playing field. The pages that follow are not just for your information, but for your transformation. If you have ever felt that there must be more to your faith, if you hunger for a deeper connection with God, and if you desire to live a life of purpose and meaning, then you are in the right place.</p>
            <h4>Questions to Consider Before You Begin:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, how would I rate my current faith life in terms of "active participation" versus "passive belief"?</li>
                <li>What do I hope to gain from this journey? What area of my life do I most hope to see transformed?</li>
                <li>Am I open to being challenged, and am I willing to put what I learn into practice?</li>
            </ul>
