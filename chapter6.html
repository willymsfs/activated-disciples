            <h3>From Masterpiece to Practice</h3>
            <p>After saying "yes" to Jesus, the journey can feel overwhelming. How do we tackle all the skills of being a disciple at once? The author introduces the concept of seeing life as a "great pilgrimage" (St. John Paul II ) and uses the analogy of a professional athlete. An athlete doesn't master the entire game overnight. They isolate and perfect individual skills through repetition until they become second nature.</p>
            <p class="quote">"The key to growing spiritually is to understand that we should not be overwhelmed by the enormity of the whole... We must take ownership of this priceless relationship with the Lord and commit the time and attention necessary to become like Christ."</p>

            <h3>The Foundational Discipline: Prayer</h3>
            <p>The most basic discipline is prayer—a conversation with God. Without it, there is little chance of knowing God or even ourselves. Jesus himself modeled this by often going away alone to pray. This section breaks down how to build a consistent and fruitful prayer life.</p>

                    <h4>1. Pick a Time</h4>
                    <p>Consistency is key. Morning is often optimal as it sets the tone for the day, but the most important thing is to choose a time that you can protect and make a priority. Aim for at least 15-30 minutes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="discipline-card">
                    <h4>2. Pick a Place</h4>
                    <p>Find a predictably available place, free from distractions. This could be a corner of your home, a parish adoration chapel, or even your office before the day begins. Creating a dedicated "holy space" serves as a physical reminder of your commitment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="discipline-card">
                    <h4>3. Pick a Bible</h4>
                    <p>You need a Bible you can "live in"—one you can underline, highlight, and make notes in. Over time, this Bible becomes a personal record of your relationship with God.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="discipline-card">
                    <h4>4. Pick a Plan</h4>
                    <p>Don't just open the Bible randomly. Have a plan. A great starting point is to pray with the Gospel reading for the day. This keeps your prayer connected to the life of the universal Church.</p>

            <h3>The Ancient Art of Praying Scripture: Lectio Divina</h3>
            <p>The author provides a step-by-step guide to <em>Lectio Divina</em> (Divine Reading), a four-part method for praying with Scripture that turns reading into a conversation with God.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-icon">1</div>
                    <h4>Step 1: Lectio (Reading)</h4>
                    <p>Read the chosen text slowly. Listen for a word or phrase that stands out to you. This is God drawing your attention. Read it a second time, paying close attention to that word or phrase.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-icon">2</div>
                    <h4>Step 2: Meditatio (Meditation)</h4>
                    <p>Focus on that word or phrase. Biblical meditation is not about emptying the mind, but filling it. Use your imagination to see your own life in the context of the verse. Chew on the text.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-icon">3</div>
                    <h4>Step 3: Oratio (Prayer)</h4>
                    <p>Now, converse with the Lord. Express your thoughts and feelings about what you've read. Share your heart with Him, and then allow for silence to listen to what He might be speaking to you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-icon">4</div>
                    <h4>Step 4: Contemplatio (Contemplation)</h4>
                    <p>This is not something you do, but a place you arrive. It is the restful state of simply being with Jesus, knowing He is with you. Rest in His word and His presence.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>A Fifth Step: Resolutio (Resolution)</h4>
                <p>The author suggests a practical fifth step: Make a brief resolve. How will you put the message you received from God into practice today at home, at work, or with friends? This makes you a "doer of the word, and not a hearer only."</p>

            <h3>The Essential Discipline: Bible Study</h3>
            <p>While prayer is about a relationship, understanding the "big picture" of the Bible is crucial for that relationship to mature. Many Christians know individual stories (David and Goliath, Noah's Ark) but don't know the overarching story of salvation history. This creates a "Word of God deficit."</p>
            <h4>How to Read the Bible: A Narrative Approach</h4>
            <p>The Bible is not written in chronological order; it's a library of 73 books grouped by literary style. The key to understanding it is to first read the 14 narrative books that carry the core storyline from Genesis to Acts. This provides a framework to which all the other books can be connected.</p>
            <div class="quote">"If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?" (Psalm 11:3). Understanding the foundational story of the Bible is the bedrock upon which a vibrant Catholic faith is built.</div>

            <h3>Chapter 6 Summary & Reflection</h3>
            <p>This chapter provides a practical roadmap for the daily life of a disciple. Growth in holiness is not accidental; it is the result of intentional, consistent disciplines. By establishing a structured prayer life through practices like Lectio Divina and committing to understand the foundational story of Scripture, we create the space in our lives for God to work, transforming us from the inside out. These disciplines are the training ground for an activated disciple.</p>
            <h4>Questions for Reflection:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Which of the four elements of building a prayer life (Time, Place, Bible, Plan) is the weakest for me right now? What is one small change I can make this week to strengthen it?</li>
                <li>Have I ever tried praying with Scripture using Lectio Divina? I will commit to trying it with this Sunday's Gospel reading.</li>
                <li>Does the idea of reading the Bible feel intimidating? How does the "narrative approach" (focusing on the 14 story books first) make it seem more achievable?</li>
            </ul>
