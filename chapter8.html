            <h3>The Mistake of "Metalanguage"</h3>
            <p>The chapter opens by identifying a common mistake zealous Catholics make: we have an "embarrassment of bounty" and, in our excitement, we often overwhelm people with the details and "metalanguage" of our faith. We talk about novenas, the secrets of Fatima, the Real Presence, or Vatican II before we have shared the foundational message of the Gospel.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: The Doctor's Office</h4>
                <p>Imagine going to the doctor for a stomach ache. You think it's a bad chili dog. The doctor returns and starts talking about the RCA, LAD, and LCx arteries, atherosclerosis, and a potential MI. You're lost in confusing terms until you finally hear the words "heart attack." We often do the same thing, using insider terms like "transubstantiation" when we should be starting with the simple, life-changing news of Jesus.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The solution is to get back to the simplicity of the *kerygma*—the basic, historic, and profound proclamation of the Gospel.</p>

            <h3>The Seven Points of the Classic Kerygma</h3>
            <p>The *kerygma* is the Greek word for "proclamation." It is the core message the Apostles preached after Pentecost. It is the power of God for conversion, and it can be summarized in seven key points that address the deepest desires of the human heart.</p>
            <div class="kerygma-grid">
                <div class="kerygma-card"><span>1</span><p>God loves you and has a plan for your life.</p></div>
                <div class="kerygma-card"><span>2</span><p>Sin will destroy you and ruin God's plan.</p></div>
                <div class="kerygma-card"><span>3</span><p>Christ Jesus died to save you.</p></div>
                <div class="kerygma-card"><span>4</span><p>Repent and believe the gospel.</p></div>
                <div class="kerygma-card"><span>5</span><p>Be baptized and receive the Holy Spirit.</p></div>
                <div class="kerygma-card"><span>6</span><p>Abide in Christ and His body, the Church.</p></div>
                <div class="kerygma-card"><span>7</span><p>Go make disciples.</p></div>
            </div>
            <p class="quote">The power for conversion is not in the cleverness of your delivery, but in the message itself.</p>

            <h3>Blending Your Story with the Kerygma: The Apostolic Method</h3>
            <p>Sharing the kerygma isn't about reading off a list. In the Book of Acts, the Apostles' sermons followed a typical three-part pattern that we can use as a model for our own conversations.</p>
            <div class="timeline">
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-icon">E</div>
                    <h4>1. The Event (The Trigger )</h4>
                    <p>The proclamation usually began with an event that caught the public's attention—a healing, the rushing wind of Pentecost, or something remarkable in a person's life. For us, the "event" is the fruit of our relationship with Christ: our peace, our joy, our hope in the midst of suffering. Your changed life is the event that makes people "stare and wonder."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-icon">X</div>
                    <h4>2. The Explanation (The Kerygma)</h4>
                    <p>Once you have their attention, you explain the reason for the hope that is in you. This is where you naturally weave in the points of the kerygma. You share how God's love and Christ's sacrifice have made a difference in your life, especially in the face of sin and brokenness. You are sharing a person, Jesus, not just a theology.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-icon">A</div>
                    <h4>3. The Exhortation (The Invitation)</h4>
                    <p>At the end of the conversation, there is an appeal to act. This is a loving invitation to take a next step. It can be as simple as, "Here is what I would do," or "A good next step for you might be..." You can invite them to read a book, go to confession, or join an RCIA group. You are lovingly inviting them to reorient their life to Christ.</p>

        <section class="concept-section royal-bg">
            <h3>Share His Story, Your Way</h3>
            <p>The key is to find your own way of sharing these seven points within your own circumstances. You don't need a dramatic story of being saved from prison or addiction. The most impressive transformation in the world is becoming a son or daughter of God. The peace in your marriage, the purpose in your work, the hope in your heart—these are the fruits the world is starving for.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: A Cup of "KeurigMa"</h4>
                <p>The author plays on the word "Keurig," the popular coffee maker. Just as K-cups are ready in an instant, we should be ready at any given moment to share the good news. Be prepared to offer a friend or acquaintance a "cup of KeurigMa"—and don't make it decaf! Give them the truth of the Gospel, which is exactly what they need.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 8 Summary & Reflection</h3>
            <p>This final chapter equips the activated disciple for mission. Evangelization is not about having all the answers or using complex theological terms. It is about sharing the simple, powerful, seven-point message of the kerygma. By using our own changed lives as the "event" that opens the door, we can explain the source of our hope and lovingly exhort others to take their own next step toward Christ. This is the apostolic method, and it is the key to effectively sharing the greatest story ever told.</p>
            <h4>Questions for Reflection:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Have I ever hesitated to share my faith because I felt I didn't know enough? How does understanding the kerygma free me from that fear?</li>
                <li>What is the "event" in my life? What fruits of my relationship with Christ (peace, joy, hope, etc.) might make others "stare and wonder"?</li>
                <li>I will practice telling my own story, weaving in the seven points of the kerygma, so I am ready to share it in a natural conversation.</li>
