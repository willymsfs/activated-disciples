            <p class="subtitle">An exploration of moving from passive admiration to active participation in faith.</p>

            <h3>Introduction: The Enthusiast vs. The Practitioner</h3>
            <p>The chapter opens with a personal story from the author, Jeff Cavins, about his passion for photography. He became an expert in theory—reading magazines, joining clubs, and even advising others. However, he owned all the gear but had never actually taken a picture. This illustrates a crucial distinction that forms the foundation of the chapter.</p>

            <h3>Core Concept: Fan vs. Follower</h3>
            <p>This is the central idea of the chapter. The author draws a parallel between his experience as a photography "fan" and how many people approach their faith. It's possible to know everything about Jesus, theology, and the Bible but never truly live it out.</p>

                    <h4>The Fan</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knows the information</li>
                        <li>Admires from a distance</li>
                        <li>Consumes content (sermons, books )</li>
                        <li>Faith is a hobby or interest</li>
                        <li>Risks boredom and stagnation</li>

                    <h4>The Follower (Disciple)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Puts knowledge into practice</li>
                        <li>Engages in a relationship</li>
                        <li>Actively participates (prays, serves)</li>

            <h3>The Danger of Being a "Christian Consumer"</h3>
            <p>The author warns against the danger of simply consuming faith-related content without application. This can lead to a false sense of spiritual maturity. The Bible itself supports this idea, as stated in James 2:17: "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead."</p>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: The Spectator at a Game</h4>
                <p>A fan in the stands knows the rules and may even shout advice, but they are not on the field. They are distracted by popcorn and people-watching. The player, however, is engaged, applying their training, and is part of the action. The call is to move from the spectator's box to the playing field of faith.</p>

        <section class="concept-section">
            <h3>The Turning Point: A Relationship, Not Just Rules</h3>
            <p>For the author, the shift happened when he realized that Christianity is not primarily about theology, doctrines, or apologetics. While these things are important, they exist to serve the ultimate goal: a dynamic, daily relationship with Jesus Christ. The goal is to walk with Jesus, become like Him, and join His mission.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1 Summary & Reflection</h3>
            <p>This chapter challenges you to self-reflect on your own spiritual life. Are you more of a fan or a follower? It sets the stage for the rest of the book, which is a call to action—to move beyond passive belief and become an "activated disciple."</p>
            <h4>Questions for Reflection:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In what areas of my life am I more of a "fan" than a "follower" (faith, hobbies, relationships )?</li>
                <li>What is one practical step I can take this week to move from knowing to doing in my faith?</li>
                <li>Do I have a hunger to put my knowledge into practice, or am I content with just learning more?</li>
            </ul>
