            <h3>The Common Misconception</h3>
            <p>We often describe our faith journey using phrases like, "I accepted Jesus," or "I decided to follow God." While our choice is essential, these phrases can subtly place the emphasis on our action. This chapter challenges that perspective by asking a crucial question: Where does the relationship with God truly begin?</p>
            <p>The answer is that becoming a disciple does not begin with us; it begins in the heart of God. God is the divine initiator. He calls us first.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you." (Jeremiah 1:5 )</p>

            <h3>The Role of the Rabbi</h3>
            <p>To understand this divine initiative, the chapter examines the role of the rabbi in Jesus' time. A rabbi was more than a modern pastor; he was a master whose life was completely submitted to the Word of God. His goal was to interpret the Torah and teach his disciples how to live it out daily.</p>

                <p class="caption">Disciples would follow their rabbi so closely they would be "covered in his dust."</p>
            </div>
            <h4>The Choice of a Disciple (Talmidim )</h4>
            <p>In this culture, a young man didn't simply choose to follow a famous rabbi. The final decision was the rabbi's. The rabbi would choose a disciple based on one critical question: "Does this young man have what it takes to become like me?" If the rabbi believed the student had the potential, he would extend the invitation. This was a profound affirmation.</p>

        <section class="concept-section">
            <h3>Core Concept: Discipleship is About Being Chosen</h3>
            <p>This is the heart of the chapter. Jesus acts as the Divine Rabbi. His words to the apostles are clear and turn our modern assumptions upside down.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>"You did not choose me, but I chose you." (John 15:16)</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is a powerful and affirming truth. In a world filled with rejection—not getting into the right college, being overlooked for a promotion, feeling unloved—the Creator of the universe has looked at you, known every detail of your life, and has chosen you. He believes you have the potential to become like Him.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example: The Last Kid Picked in Gym Class</h4>
                <p>Many of us remember the feeling of being picked for a team in school. The anxiety of being chosen last creates a feeling of inadequacy. The Gospel message is the opposite of this. It's the team captain—Jesus Himself—walking over to you first and saying, "I choose you." He doesn't choose the "best of the best" by society's standards; He chose fishermen, a tax collector, and a zealot. He chooses you.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="concept-section royal-bg">
            <h3>Chosen by More Than a Rabbi</h3>
            <p>While Jesus was a rabbi, He was also infinitely more. He is the second Person of the Trinity, the Word of God made flesh. Other rabbis quoted the great teachers of the past to support their positions. Jesus spoke with a different kind of authority—His own.</p>
            <p>This means our relationship with Him is both deeply personal (like a disciple walking with a master) and communal and cosmic (worshipping the omnipotent God of the universe). He is both the Rabbi we walk with and the Lord we adore.</p>

                <p class="caption">Jesus is both the approachable teacher and the divine Lord.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 3 Summary & Reflection</h3>
            <p>This chapter reframes discipleship not as a life we choose, but as a life to which we are chosen. God is the initiator, the Rabbi who sees our potential and invites us to become like Him. Our "yes" is a response to His prior "yes" to us. This truth provides a foundation of security, purpose, and profound worth, freeing us from the burden of having to earn our place and allowing us to simply respond to the one who has already called us by name.</p>
            <h4>Questions for Reflection:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How does the truth "I have been chosen by God" change the way I see myself and my struggles?</li>
                <li>Have I been living as if my relationship with God depends entirely on my own efforts? How can I rest in the fact that He chose me first?</li>
                <li>Jesus chose ordinary people to be His disciples. How does this encourage me to embrace my own calling, right where I am?</li>
