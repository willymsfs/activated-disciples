## üìñ Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to translate the key teachings of "The Activated Disciple" into an accessible, well-organized, and visually appealing web format. Each page is crafted to explain the book's ideas like a teacher, using deep explanations, illustrations, and practical examples to make the concepts of discipleship clear and actionable.

This repository was created as a personal learning project to practice HTML and CSS skills while engaging deeply with the book's content.
